# Electrophysiology Bursting Analysis

A hallmark of CA3 neural networks is intrinsic burst firing. In some instances, this burst firing can be spontaneous, without the need for stimulation. This is of particular relevance when analyzing epileptiform acivity in the hippocampus which manifests itself as highly synchronous bursting activty. Single-unit electrophysiology techniques allow us to "listen in" on these bursting networks and extract physiological time-series data (Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials -- fEPSP).

This R-project utilizes IgorR package to unpack and read Igor binary file.  
It serves as exploratory data analysis tool for fEPSP datasets.
